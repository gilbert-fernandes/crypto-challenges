		 * 1. Let KEYSIZE be the guessed length of the key; try values from 2 to (say) 40.
		 *  
		 * 2. Write a function to compute the edit distance/Hamming distance between two strings.
		 *    The Hamming distance is just the number of differing bits.
		 *    The distance between "this is a test"and "wokka wokka!!!" is 37 
		 *    
		 * 3. For each KEYSIZE, take the first KEYSIZE worth of bytes, and the second KEYSIZE
		 *    worth of bytes, and find the edit distance between them. Normalize this result by
		 *    dividing by KEYSIZE. 
		 * 
		 * 4. The KEYSIZE with the smallest normalized edit distance is probably the key.
		 *    You could proceed perhaps with the smallest 2-3 KEYSIZE values. Or take 4 KEYSIZE
		 *    blocks instead of 2 and average the distances.
		 *    
		 * 5. Now that you probably know the KEYSIZE: break the ciphertext into blocks of KEYSIZE length.
		 * 
		 * 6. Now transpose the blocks: make a block that is the first byte of every block, and a block
		 *    that is the second byte of every block, and so on.
		 *    
		 * 7. Solve each block as if it was single-character XOR. You already have code to do this. 
		 * 
		 * 8. For each block, the single-byte XOR key that produces the best looking histogram is the
		 *    repeating-key XOR key byte for that block. Put them together and you have the key.
