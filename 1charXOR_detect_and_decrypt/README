implementation of set 1 challenge 4
finds which one of the 60-char strings in 4.txt file (327 lines) contains a 1-char XOR encrypted line
and outputs the best key found for the best line
decryption of the encrypted line + character frequency

uses about 0,5 ms per line to brute force all possible 1-char keys
and output the good one at the end on my machine(*)
(150 to 200 ms for 327 lines)

(*) Intel Core i5-3320M @ 2.6 GHz
